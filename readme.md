# Site Functionality Overview

## General Information

You will find several buttons on the site that currently do not have any functionality. These are placeholders for additional features that I am working on.

## Main Features

When you first open the site, you are presented with an interface where you can either click "Yes" or "No" on profiles. I plan to develop this further so that users can set up a profile before engaging with the main features.

The box on the right side of the screen will display your potential matches. A green light indicates a "Yes" response, while a red light indicates "No." 

When you click on a green light, the person's profile will be added to the sidebar. Hovering over this profile in the sidebar will trigger a hover effect and overlay an "X" on the image. Clicking the "X" will remove the match from the sidebar.

If you click on a person in the sidebar, their profile page will open. Here, you can either remove the match or open the chat. The chat interface is styled but not yet functional.

In the sidebar, you can also search for your matches by age or name.
